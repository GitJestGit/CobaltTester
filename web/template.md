<h4>Status</h4>
The status of an instance can be 3 values:
<ul>
<li><code>Online</code>: Frontend and API are both online.</li>
<li><code>Partial</code>: Frontend or API are offline/not online.</li>
<li><code>Offline</code>: Frontend and API are both offline.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Score</h4>
A score is the percentage of media that instance was able to download. The higher the score to 100, the more media that instance can download. Some services require certain cookies to be set, so not all instances can handle certain websites.

There can also be region blocking based on where the instance is.
