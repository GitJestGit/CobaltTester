### What is cobalt?
cobalt is an open-source media downloader. It supports a wide range of social media websites. No ads, tracking, or paywalls. It was created by [wukko](https://wukko.me/) and [jj](https://github.com/dumbmoron).
### What is an "instance"?
An instance is simply another "copy" of cobalt. Because cobalt is open source, anyone can start up their own instance. However, the official cobalt instance is `cobalt.tools` and `co.wuk.sh`. All others on this list are community created.
### Why are multiple instances needed?
Simple: if the main cobalt instance goes offline, you can still use another instance. Decentralization is good.
### What is the difference between API and frontend?
The frontend is the pretty homescreen you see when you visit a cobalt instance. The API is another module that handles any download requests sent by the frontend. It does the processing and handling. When you enter a URL and download it, the frontend sends a request to the API, and it returns the media back.

If you're a regular user, you probably want to use the frontend.
