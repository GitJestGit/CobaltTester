<summary>What is cobalt?</summary>
cobalt is an open-source media downloader. It supports a wide range of social media websites. No ads, tracking, or paywalls. It was created by [imput](https://github.com/imputnet/).

<details>
<summary>What is an "instance"?</summary>
An instance is simply another "copy" of cobalt. Because cobalt is open source, anyone can start up their own instance. However, the official cobalt instance is <code>cobalt.tools</code> and <code>co.wuk.sh</code>. All others on this list are community created.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are multiple instances needed?</summary>
Simple: if the main cobalt instance goes offline, you can still use another instance. Decentralization is good. Servers can be located in different regions to bypass different region limits for media.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between API and frontend?</summary>
The frontend is the pretty homescreen you see when you visit a cobalt instance. The API is another module that handles any download requests sent by the frontend. It does the processing and handling. When you enter a URL and download it, the frontend sends a request to the API, and it returns the media back.

If you're a regular user, you probably want to use the frontend.
