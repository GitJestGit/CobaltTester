# hyper's cobalt instance list
This is a list of different cobalt instances I gathered. If you want your instance to be added, ping @hyperdefined on the [cobalt discord](https://discord.gg/pQPt8HBUPu). This list is updated manually through a script. All requests use the user agent `CobaltInstances (+https://instances.hyper.lol)`.

Note: the only "official" instance is from wukko, <code>cobalt.tools</code>. All others are 3rd party and not official.
