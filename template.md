# hyper's cobalt instance list
This is a list of different cobalt instances. This list is generated every hour. All requests use the user agent `CobaltTester (+https://instances.hyper.lol)`.

The only official instance cobalt is from wukko, <code>cobalt.tools</code>. All others listed are 3rd party. These are either user submitted or manually found. If you want to be added/removed, ping @hyperdefined on the [cobalt discord](https://discord.gg/pQPt8HBUPu).

## Status
The status of an instance can be 3 values:
* `Online`: Frontend and API are both online and working. Both were able to respond, and the API was able to download media.
* `Partial`: Frontend or API are offline/not working. Most of the time, the API couldn't download the test media.
* `Offline`: Frontend and API are both offline.

## Score
A score is the percentage of media that instance was able to download. The higher the score to 100, the more media that instance can download. Some services require certain cookies to be set, so not all instances can handle certain websites.

There can also be region blocking based on where the instance is.

# Instances
