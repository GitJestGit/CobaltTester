# hyper's cobalt instance list
This is a list of different cobalt instances. If you want your instance to be added, ping @hyperdefined on the [cobalt discord](https://discord.gg/pQPt8HBUPu). This list is generated every 15 minutes. All requests use the user agent `CobaltInstances (+https://instances.hyper.lol)`.

The only official instance is from wukko, <code>cobalt.tools</code>. All others listed are 3rd party.

The status of an instance can be 3 values:
* `Online`: Frontend and API are both online.
* `Partial`: Frontend or API are offline.
* `Offline`: Frontend and API are both offline.
