# hyper's cobalt instance list
This is a list of different cobalt instances. If you want your instance to be added, ping @hyperdefined on the [cobalt discord](https://discord.gg/pQPt8HBUPu). This list is generated every 15 minutes. All requests use the user agent `CobaltInstances (+https://instances.hyper.lol)`.

The only "official" instance is from wukko, <code>cobalt.tools</code>. All others are 3rd party and not official.

An instance is down only when the API is unreachable. The frontend might work, but functionality will not. If an instance is down for a notably long time, it will be removed from the list.

If you want to fetch this list, see the [API](https://instances.hyper.lol/api) page.
